### Dependencies
This program requires the following modules from the Python 3.10 standard library:
```
argparse    # parser for command-line options, args and sub-commands
curser      # terminal handling for character-cell displays
dataclasses # structured classes for storing data
math        # mathematical functions (namely, ceil)
os          # misc operating system interfaces (namely, file i/o)
time        # time access and conversions (namely, sleep)
typing      # support for type hints
```

### Instructions
Program execution instructions can be found by entering `python3 driver.py --help`:
```
usage: driver.py [-h] [--algm ALGORITHM] PATH PATTERN

This PROGRAM features an implementation for string match using bruteforce,
Horspool or Boyer-Moore as its string matching algorithm.

positional arguments:
  PATH              path to file containing sequence of n chars
  PATTERN           pattern of m chars to attempt match with first occurrence
                    in sequence

options:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  --algm ALGORITHM  chosen algorithm for string matching problem (BRUTEFORCE,
                    HORSPOOL or BOYERMOORE) (default is BRUTEFORCE algorithm)

```
A path to a file containing a sequence of chars is provided as first positional command-line argument `PATH` followed by a pattern of chars as second positional argument `PATTERN` (if `PATTERN` contains whitespace characters, use quotation marks surrounding argument).  The algorithm chosen for the string matching problem is specified using the `--algm ALGORITHM` option, whereby `ALGORITHM` can be `BRUTEFORCE`, `HORSPOOL` or `BOYERMOORE` (`BRUTEFORCE` is used by default if no algorithm specified).  Proceed with each ensuing step in the algorithm by pressing any key on the keyboard.

For example, the program will attempt to match with the first occurrence of the pattern *and, and* in a sequence of chars from file *example1.txt* using the default algorithm by entering `python3 driver.py example1.txt "and, and"`.

Each char in the pattern will be aligned below the sequence of chars at the beginning of the sequence.  If a char in the pattern matches with a corresponding char in the sequence, that char will be highlighted green before proceeding with the next comparison.  If the pattern matches with an occurrence in the sequence, a match has been found and the program will terminate; otherwise, the pattern will shift by a single character and resume comparisons until no remaining chars are left in the sequence.

Alternatively, the program will attempt to match the pattern *and, and* in a sequence of chars from file *example1.txt* using Horspool's string matching algorithm by entering `python3 driver.py example1.txt "and, and" --algm HORSPOOL`.

A shift table of distances and corresponding chars from the alphabet used by the pattern and sequence will be displayed above the sequence of chars.  The char in the sequence aligned with the end of the pattern will be highlighted blue in the shift table.  When a mismatch occurs, the pattern will by shifted by the distance of the corresponding char aligned with the end of the pattern.  Comparisons resume after each time the pattern is shifted until the pattern matches with an occurrence in the sequence or no more remaining chars are left in the sequence.

### Links
Here are some resources I found useful when developing this program:
- [dataclasses â€” Data Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) Data Classes (introduced in Python 3.7) are analogous to Structures (structs) in C; especially useful for data representations that don't require their own set of functions or constructor.
